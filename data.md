the issues that must be resolved to be determined. 
1.3 Identify and assess adverse impacts in own opera-
tions, supply chains and business relationships

point 1.3 above), Direct Suppliers have action plans
in place to prevent, mitigate and remedy potential
and actual adverse human rights and environmental
impacts that they may cause or contribute to through
their own activities, or which may be directly linked to
their operations, products or services by their business
The Requirements may be amended from time to time, as
international standards, national or supranational regulations
or industry standards evolve.
Current Requirements are based on, among others, the

effectiveness of their HREDD management systems.

cess with their own suppliers, which includes cascad-

pliers’ performance, agreeing on their supplier action
plans, monitoring progress, and taking action.
